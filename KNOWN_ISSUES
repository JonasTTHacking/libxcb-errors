- XGE and XKB events are not handled correctly (Should another API for this be
  added? Does it perhaps really make sense to have an API which gets an
  xcb_generiv_event_t*)?
- I'm not sure about xcb_errors_get_name_for_minor_code() being able to return
  NULL
- Should the extension's name be included in strings for that ext? More
  generally, think about how this library can be used and if such usage would
  result in "good" messages.
